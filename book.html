                        <h3>Internal Office Movement</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes an extra hand is needed for a relocation task - even if the relocation does not involve a change to a new address. If your employees, for example, need to move offices or need the filing cabinets from the basement and
                            up to the ceiling, then MoveTest can solve the task by sending people out to you to help carry. Our relocation business calls service internal work, and we can provide as many people as you need for as long as the need is there.
                            Of course, you only pay for the hours we are with you. Contact us at flyting@flytbedst.dk or phone 30 30 60 60 and tell us about your tasks, and we will provide the right staff - anytime and anywhere in Taastrup, Glostrup and
                            all of Denmark.

                        <p><b>Clearing The Estate</b></p>
                        <p>We can offer to clear the apartment / house in whole or in part. That is, buy what is marketable and leave the rest, or a total clearing where all rooms are cleared, cabinets, kitchen and possibly. the storage room is cleared for
                            all movable property, curtains, lamps and loose rugs are removed.
                        </p>
                        <p>Be aware that not everything that is usable is also marketable. What is marketable counts on the positive side, the work of removing what is not marketable goes the opposite way. Once we have seen the estate we can offer a fixed
                            price offer to buy it, or a fixed price to clear it. It only takes a short time to look at the estate.</p>
